## Style Guide
- Do define one thing, such as a service or component, per file.
- Consider limiting files to 400 lines of code
- Do small functions (max 75 lines)
- Do use consistent names for all symbols.
- Do follow a pattern that describes the symbol's feature then its type. The recommended pattern is `feature.type.ts`
- Do use dashes to separate words in the descriptive name.
- Do use dots to separate the descriptive name from the type
- Do use dashed-case or kebab-case for naming the element selectors of components.
